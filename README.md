# Iris_EDA

## Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, containing measurements of four features for three different species of iris flowers. The goal of this EDA is to understand the characteristics of the dataset, visualize the distributions of the features, and gain insights into the relationships between the variables.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of the following attributes:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Contents

The project includes the following files:
- **iris_data.csv:** The raw dataset in CSV format.
- **eda.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process and visualizations.
- **images/:** Folder containing visualizations and graphs generated during the analysis.

## Analysis Steps

The EDA includes the following key steps:
1. Loading and inspecting the dataset.
2. Summary statistics and data information.
3. Visualizing feature distributions.
4. Pairwise feature comparisons.
5. Species-wise analysis.
6. Correlation analysis.

## Tools Used

- **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive development environment for running the analysis.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Libraries for data visualization.

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-eda.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd iris-eda`
3. Open and run the `eda.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.

## Acknowledgments

The Iris dataset was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems."
